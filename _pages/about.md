I aslo have extensive engineering experiences in computational advertising through my two summer internships at [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/).

I previously studied telecommnunication engineering at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) working with Weimin Wu and [Chen Tian](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/tianchen/). I love climbing, hiking, swimming and would love to learn painting and piano when I have more time.
