I am a Computer Science PhD student working with [Nick Duffield](https://nickduffield.net/) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/). My research focuses on applying machine learning to tackle challenging problems in the remote sensing area. I also have extensive engineering experiences in computational advertising through my two summer internships at [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/).

I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in telecommunication engineering at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/), working with Weimin Wu and [Chen Tian](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/tianchen/). 

I love climbing, hiking, swimming, and would love to learn painting and piano when I have more time.
